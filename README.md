# VSP-Processing
Processing VSP data with Python

I am fairly new to Python and dealing with SEG-Y data with Segpy or Obspy.

I am trying to build a series of small codes to perform standard VSP processing sequences for 3D-VSP dataset.

Any help or comments on the codes would be most welcomed.
I am mainly suffering from codes that are running fairly slowly at the moment and I am looking for ways to improve their running time.
