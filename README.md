# VSP-Processing
Processing VSP data with Python

I am trying to build a series of small codes to perform standard VSP processing sequences for 3D-VSP dataset.

I have built a few tools for Obspy and Segpy (my prefered way).

Any help or comments on the codes would be most welcomed.
I am mainly suffering from codes that are running fairly slowly at the moment and I am looking for ways to improve their running time.
